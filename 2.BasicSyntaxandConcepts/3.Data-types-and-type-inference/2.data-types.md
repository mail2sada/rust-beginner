### Detailed Descriptions:

#### Scalar Types

1. **Integers**:
   - **Signed (`i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`)**: Can store both positive and negative values.
   - **Unsigned (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`)**: Can store only non-negative values.

2. **Floating-Point Numbers**:
   - **`f32` and `f64`**: Represent decimal numbers. `f64` is the default and offers higher precision.

3. **Boolean**:
   - **`bool`**: Represents `true` or `false`.

4. **Character**:
   - **`char`**: Represents a single Unicode character, which is four bytes in size.

#### Compound Types

1. **Tuples**:
   - Can store multiple values of different types. The length is fixed once declared.

2. **Arrays**:
   - Store multiple values of the same type. Arrays have a fixed length.

3. **Slices**:
   - Dynamically-sized views into arrays or other sequences. They do not own the data they reference.

#### String Types

1. **`String`**:
   - A growable, heap-allocated data structure used for storing strings.

2. **`&str`**:
   - A slice that references a part of a `String` or a string literal. It does not own the data.

#### Custom Types

1. **Structs**:
   - Custom data types that package together multiple related values.

2. **Enums**:
   - Types that can be one of several variants, each of which can hold different types and amounts of associated data.

3. **Type Aliases**:
   - New names for existing types, improving code readability and maintainability.

#### Pointer Types

1. **References (`&T` and `&mut T`)**:
   - Borrowed pointers that reference a value. `&T` is immutable, while `&mut T` is mutable.

2. **Raw Pointers (`*const T` and `*mut T`)**:
   - Low-level pointers that can be used in unsafe code for manual memory management.

#### Function Types

- **Function Pointers (`fn`)**:
  - Allow storing and passing functions as values.

#### Never Type

- **`!`**:
  - Indicates a function that never returns (e.g., functions that always panic or loop indefinitely).

### Final Notes

This table and detailed descriptions cover the primary data types in Rust. Understanding these types is fundamental to writing effective and idiomatic Rust code. Rust's type system ensures safety and performance, helping prevent common programming errors related to type mismatches and memory safety.
