### Basic Questions

1. **How do you declare a mutable variable in Rust?**
   - **Answer**: You declare a mutable variable using the `mut` keyword. For example:
     ```rust
     let mut x = 5;
     ```

2. **What is the default mutability of variables in Rust?**
   - **Answer**: By default, variables in Rust are immutable.

3. **What happens if you try to mutate an immutable variable?**
   - **Answer**: Rust will produce a compile-time error if you try to mutate an immutable variable.

4. **Can you reassign a new value to an immutable variable?**
   - **Answer**: No, once an immutable variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned.

5. **How do you shadow a variable in Rust, and what does it mean?**
   - **Answer**: Shadowing allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. The new variable shadows the old one, and the old variable is no longer accessible. For example:
     ```rust
     let x = 5;
     let x = x + 1; // shadows the previous x
     ```

### Intermediate Questions

6. **Explain the difference between `let` and `const` in Rust.**
   - **Answer**: `let` is used to declare variables that can be either mutable or immutable, while `const` is used to declare constants that are always immutable and must have a type annotation. Constants are evaluated at compile time.

7. **What are the rules for variable lifetimes in Rust?**
   - **Answer**: A variable's lifetime is the scope within which the variable is valid. When the scope ends, the variable is dropped and its memory is freed. Rust's ownership system ensures that references to variables do not outlive the variables themselves.

8. **Can you create a mutable reference to an immutable variable? Why or why not?**
   - **Answer**: No, you cannot create a mutable reference to an immutable variable because it violates Rust's safety guarantees. You can only create mutable references to mutable variables.

9. **What is variable shadowing, and how does it differ from mutability?**
   - **Answer**: Variable shadowing allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, effectively hiding the previous variable. It differs from mutability in that shadowing creates a new variable, while mutability allows the value of the same variable to change.

10. **Explain the use of the `mut` keyword in function parameters.**
    - **Answer**: Using the `mut` keyword in function parameters allows the function to modify the value of the parameter. For example:
      ```rust
      fn increment(mut x: i32) -> i32 {
          x += 1;
          x
      }
      ```

### Advanced Questions

11. **What happens if you try to use a variable after it has been moved?**
    - **Answer**: Rust will produce a compile-time error. When a variable is moved, its ownership is transferred to another variable, and the original variable can no longer be used.

12. **Describe the concept of borrowing and how it relates to mutability.**
    - **Answer**: Borrowing allows one part of code to temporarily access data owned by another part without taking ownership. Immutable borrowing (`&T`) allows read-only access, while mutable borrowing (`&mut T`) allows read and write access. Rust's borrow checker ensures that at most one mutable reference or any number of immutable references exist at a time.

13. **Can you have multiple mutable references to the same variable at the same time? Why or why not?**
    - **Answer**: No, Rust does not allow multiple mutable references to the same variable at the same time to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. Only one mutable reference or multiple immutable references are allowed.

14. **What is interior mutability, and which Rust constructs allow it?**
    - **Answer**: Interior mutability is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data. Constructs like `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, `Mutex<T>`, and `RwLock<T>` enable interior mutability.

15. **Explain the difference between `let mut x = 5;` and `let x = &mut 5;`.**
    - **Answer**: `let mut x = 5;` declares a mutable variable `x` with a value of `5`. `let x = &mut 5;` creates an immutable variable `x` that is a mutable reference to the value `5`.

### Trick Questions

16. **What will the following code print, and why?**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        let y = &x;
        println!("{}", x);
        println!("{}", y);
    }
    ```
    - **Answer**: The code will print `5` twice. `y` is an immutable reference to `x`, and both `x` and `y` can be used because they are immutable.

17. **Is the following code valid? If not, why?**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        let y = &mut x;
        let z = &x;
        println!("{}", y);
    }
    ```
    - **Answer**: The code is not valid. You cannot have a mutable reference `&mut x` and an immutable reference `&x` at the same time. Rust's borrow checker will raise a compile-time error.

18. **What is the output of the following code?**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        let y = &mut x;
        *y += 1;
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    ```
    - **Answer**: The output is `6`. The mutable reference `y` allows modifying the value of `x`.

19. **Can you explain why the following code does not compile?**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        {
            let y = &mut x;
        }
        let z = &x;
    }
    ```
    - **Answer**: The code actually compiles. The mutable reference `y` goes out of scope before the immutable reference `z` is created, so there is no conflict.

20. **What is the result of this code, and why?**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        let y = &mut x;
        *y += 1;
        let z = &x;
        println!("{}", z);
    }
    ```
    - **Answer**: The code will not compile. You cannot create an immutable reference `&x` while a mutable reference `&mut x` is still in scope. Rust's borrow checker will prevent this.
